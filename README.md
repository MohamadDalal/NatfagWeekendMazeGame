# NatfagWeekendMazeGame
A simple maze game implementation for Aalborg natfagsweekend. Just run game.py to run the game and see it get solved.

# How to change solver algorithm
All you need to do is rewrite the mazeSolver function inside game.py

# There is only one level. Where can I get more?
This level was generated by this [maze generator](https://www.mazegenerator.net/). It was then manually made into a levelList.

~~Maybe one day I will make a menu for this game, and have a level maker that can easily makes levels.~~

I have made a level maker. It is in its own script levelMaker.py. You can load and save levels and edit by adding and removing blocks in the maze.
